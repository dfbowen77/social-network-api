# social-network-api
This repo represents my submission for the module 18 challenge to create a social network api using MongoDB and Mongoose. 

## Description
The following program is designed to meet the requirements of the Module 18 Challenge. It represents the beginnings of the backend of a social network api. The web application was made using MongoDB, Mongoose, Node.js, and Express.js. The backend was tested using Insomnia. The social network api allows for the creation, retrieval, updating, and deleting of users. Users can create thoughts as well as retrieve, update, and delete their thoughts. They can also add and delete friends from their social network. Finally, users can react to the thoughts of other users.
